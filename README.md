This site documents my work on the AI4R Hardware Challenges 0 through 4 using a RapsberryPi

1. Challenge #0: Acquire some hardware.
2. Challenge #1: Sense the environment in some way.
3. Challenge #2: Affect the environment in some way.
4. Challenge #3: Implement something pertaining to one of the lectures in hardware.

There are two elements:
